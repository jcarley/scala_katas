/**
  * ### Problem statement
  *
  * Create a program that takes a product name as input and retrieves the current
  * price and quantity for that product. The product data is in a data file in the
  * JSON format and looks like this:
  *
  *     {
  *       "products" : [
  *         {"name": "Widget", "price": 25.00, "quantity": 5 },
  *         {"name": "Thing", "price": 15.00, "quantity": 5 },
  *         {"name": "Dodad", "price": 5.00, "quantity": 10 }
  *     ] }
  *
  * Print out the product name, price, and quantity if the product is found. If no
  * product matches the search, state that no product was found and start over.
  *
  * ### Example Output
  *
  *     What is the product name? iPad
  *     Sorry, that product was not found in our inventory.
  *     What is the product name? Widget
  *     Name: Widget
  *     Price: $25.00
  *     Quantity on hand: 5
  *
  * ### Constraints
  *
  * * The file is in the JSON format.  Use a JSON parser to pull the values out of
  *   the file.
  * * If a record is not found, prompt again.
  *
  * ### Challenges
  *
  * * Ensure that the product search is case-insensitive.
  * * When a product is not found, ask if the product should be added. If yes, ask
  *   for the price and the quantity and save it in the JSON file. Ensure the
  *   newly-added product is immediately available for searching without restarting
  *   the program.
  * * When a product is found save the search result into a history file with the
  *    following JSON format.  Use a iso8601 format for the searched_at date.
  *
  *     {
  *       "history" : [
  *         {"name": "iPad", searched_at: "2015-09-22T19:21:48.461+02:00", result: "Not Found" },
  *         {"name": "Widget", searched_at: "2015-09-22T19:21:48.461+02:00", result: "Found" }
  *     ] }
  *
